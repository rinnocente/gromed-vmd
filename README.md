# gromed-vmd
gromed + vmd

vmd license for its code imposes some restrictions on its distribution.
Private people can not distribute the code,
organizations only to members. You need to register to download the code.
It is not legal to include vmd in a docker container.
Therefore we prepared a small docker hat for the gromed docker
that easily permits to include vmd, provided that users download by
themself the vmd code base.
